Wealthy Single Mommy
Industry: Personal Finance

Services: SEO / Monetization

Starting line
Emma Johnson, Founder of Wealthysinglemmomy.com, had a major setback when we first started working for her: she was losing more than 75% of her organic traffic. Because of that, we put monetization on the back burner and focused on fixing problems that were causing her to lose the user�s interest when they were navigating on her page.

Finish line
Emma topped out at 67k organic visitors a few months before she began working with Growth 360. After the slight setback of a penalty, we are now back to 62k visitors and climbing.

Work in progress
After our initial site fixes, we focused our efforts towards expanding Emma into affiliates that make the most sense for her and her brand. We are continually working on posting new content that expands her reach into more affiliate-related areas.

I am so grateful to work with Growth360. Their team is so professional, knowledgeable and are taking my site and business to a level that was unattainable without them.

Cash Money Life
Industry: Insurance

Services: SEO / Website Monetization, Content Writing

Starting line
Cashmoneylife.com came to us with two major problems to be fixed: site auditing and recovering lost traffic. Our goal in solving these problems was to ultimately increase revenue on the site.

Work in progress
We are currently still in the auditing process of Cashmoneylife.com. As we work through that, we continue to identify posts that need updating for monetization purposes. With both of these combined efforts, we are already seeing success in numbers.

Working with the Growth 360 team has been an absolute pleasure. Together, we mapped out an SEO and growth strategy that included a holistic look at our site. We focused on identifying strengths, opportunities, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. With that in hand, we started implementing the plan. We made quick gains in certain areas and we are currently riding the momentum of continued growth. I look forward to continuing our relationship. Onward and upward!

Good Financial Cents
Industry: Personal Finance
Services: SEO / Website Monetization, Content Writing
Starting line
Jeff had a very popular Personal Finance blog that was not getting the same kind of revenue that other similar bloggers were generating.

He brought us in to drive more traffic and find more ways for his site to generate income.

Our services
We help GFC with increasing the traffic that comes to the site and properly monetizing the site to take advantage of that traffic.

This includes adjusting our content to make sure it is well received by the main search engines, making sure already popular pages have the right advertisers, updating existing content that has the chance to improve for search traffic, and identifying new content that is related to current content and can expand the organic reach of the site.

Finish line
Traffic has grown from just over 250,000 sessions per month to over 750,000 sessions per month.

Work in progress
We are continuing to look for new revenue opportunities as new advertisers come into the financial space.

We are also looking to expand his reach into financial content that is not covered with current content. The site has hit with a minor search engine penalty in February and we are fixing content that has caused the site to go down from that high month in January (a lull from Jan to Feb is normal but not that much). We have almost completely recovered that lost traffic in less than six months.

 Working with Growth 360 has been immeasurable. My revenues have more than 10�xd and I have so much more time to focus on the areas of the business I enjoy and time with my family. I can�t recommend them enough. 
Jeff Rose, Founder, GoodFinancialCents.com
